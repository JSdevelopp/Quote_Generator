# In this project I created a working quote generator that is able to generate new quotes with a button as well share a quote you like to twitter! This project contains JavaSscript, CSS properties for basic web app designs and to display with basic HTML skeleton structure.

# In this project, I experiemented with twitter's official API to share a quote on users's feed. This web app is mobile respsonsive where the sizes were choosen for smaller devices and tablets.
